## Hi there 👋

# About me
I have a background in renewable energy engineering, with a focus on renewables integration and energy optimization. I have a special interest for developing and applying advanced models to support decision-making at the intersection of energy systems and markets. I want to explore how uncertainty management and market participation optimization can enhance the reliability, efficiency, and profitability of battery systems and renewable energy portfolios.

# What I have worked on
- LP MILP energy optimization (economic dispatch, unit commitment, etc.)
- Integrated Assessment Modeling of energy shocks and climate policy
- Electricity, Emissions and Climate Risk databases for statistical extrolation and analysis
