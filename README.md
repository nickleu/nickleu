## Hi there 👋

## About me
I have a background in renewable energy engineering, with a focus on renewables integration and energy optimization. I have a special interest for developing and applying advanced models to support decision-making at the intersection of energy systems and markets. I want to explore how uncertainty management and market participation optimization can enhance the reliability, efficiency, and profitability of battery systems and renewable energy portfolios.

## What I have worked on
- LP & MILP energy optimization: economic dispatch of generated energy, mulit-period unit commitment, energy market clearing.
- Integrated Assessment Modeling of green hydrogen for industrial heat, assessing energy price shocks, policy impacts, and fuel-switching dynamics between hydrogen and natural gas.
- Data management of electricity, emissions, and climate-risk datasets, designed for statistical extrapolation, scenario analysis, and quantitative assessment of energy- and climate-related risks.
